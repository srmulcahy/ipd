# ipd - Isochemical phase diagrams (pseudosections)

Resources, notes, and benchmarks for creating isochemical phase diagrams with [Theriak-Domino](https://titan.minpet.unibas.ch/minpet/theriak/theruser.html) and [Perple_X](http://www.perplex.ethz.ch/). 

This mostly written as a notebook as I better learn the ins and outs of each software program, attempting to benchmark various published examples. Hopefully others find something useful - see the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/srmulcahy/ipd/wiki) for more information.
